# Wednesday Week36

[Slides for today](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week36/Wednesday/Week36_Wed.pdf)

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the MODELTEST paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### MODELTEST algorithm paper

You should read this paper before Monday class:

D Posada, K A Crandall, [MODELTEST: testing the model of DNA substitution](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/14.9.817)., Bioinformatics, Volume 14, Issue 9, 1998, Pages 817–818

Before reading the paper, read G5. 

Then, you are going to comment it in groups and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PE2yuAdapNSAZIzPYr7VewSzIq8TAQP5zHpx2gPt3rI). 

Odd-numbered groups will first address questions 1-6, while even-numbered groups should initially focus on 7-11.
