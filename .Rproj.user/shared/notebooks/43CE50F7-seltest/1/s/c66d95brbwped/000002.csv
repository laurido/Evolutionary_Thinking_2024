# For 3.5.1

# It is evident that most early strains were extinguished relatively early, likely as a result to the combined effect of host immune adaptation and competition from more fit strains. The latter radiated/diversified into many different substrains, and the process kept repeating. Essentially, we see how the 'best' strain/few strains at infecting humans took over most infection cases and reduced all other strains to minimal infectivity success. This suggests powerful selection pressures acting in favour of any 'better' strain.
