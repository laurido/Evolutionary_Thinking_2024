# For 2.1:

# - flu virus strains evolve over time, with selection happening on their mechanisms of targeting a specific protein

# - coronaviruses likely evolve in the same general way, backed by the diversity of effects that they have (some cause mild illensses, others severe)

# - considering these, SARS-CoV-2 might have originated as a diverging coronavirus strain that specialised in a specific target protein, with rapid evolution as a consequence of host-pathogen evolutionary arms race driving its infection capability
