# For 4.1:

# We can observe that the highest density of mutations is confined to some specific genes or regions, with others showing a significantly decreased mutation density. We could likely assume that the regions with reduced mutation densities are subject to negative selection, as mutations affecting the structure of the proteins coded by these genes would likely have stronger deleterious effects and decrease the fitness of the virus.
