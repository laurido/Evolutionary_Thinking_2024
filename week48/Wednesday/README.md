Today we are going to discuss a paper exploring mutation rate variability and evolution in the vertebrate germline - please read it by Wednesday:

Hallast et al. [Assembly of 43 human Y chromosomes reveals extensive complexity and variation](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06425-6). Nature, 2023.

You can find the questions for the paper discussion [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15riGSOMTe0HZXdB0stKXwpH5xofoYnnC-4h7oasA3K8).

Some guideline answers to the questions will show up [here](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week48/Wednesday/Hallast_paper_answers.txt) after the TA session
